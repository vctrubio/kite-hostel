## Overview

This Next.js application manages kiteboarding lessons with real-time scheduling capabilities designed for wind-dependent operations. When wind changes, schedules change - this app synchronizes those changes across APIs, PDFs, and Excel exports.

## Key Features

‚Ä¢ **Wind-Responsive Scheduling** - Built for the dynamic nature of kiteboarding operations
‚Ä¢ **Real-Time Updates** - Synchronous changes across all interfaces and exports
‚Ä¢ **Dual Interface Approach**:
  - **Whiteboard** - Mobile-first approach for quick daily operations
  - **Billboard** - Desktop drag-and-drop interface for detailed lesson planning
‚Ä¢ **Multi-Format Exports** - CSV, Excel, WhatsApp, PDF, and medical email exports
‚Ä¢ **Teacher Portal** - Hour tracking and event confirmation system via UserWallet authentication
‚Ä¢ **Admin Dashboard** - Comprehensive entity management system with configurable table views

## Architecture

‚Ä¢ **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router (server-first approach)
‚Ä¢ **Backend**: Drizzle ORM with Supabase PostgreSQL database  
‚Ä¢ **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access control
‚Ä¢ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
‚Ä¢ **Real-time**: Server-side rendering with optimistic updates

## Core Applications

### Whiteboard (`/app/whiteboard/`)
Mobile-friendly interface optimized for daily kite lesson management:
‚Ä¢ Quick lesson creation and status updates
‚Ä¢ Real-time filtering by date
‚Ä¢ Teacher assignment and equipment tracking
‚Ä¢ Weather-responsive scheduling adjustments

### Billboard (`/app/billboard/`)  
Advanced drag-and-drop scheduling interface:
‚Ä¢ Visual teacher column layout
‚Ä¢ Drag bookings from student queue to teacher schedules
‚Ä¢ Dynamic duration adjustments
‚Ä¢ Conflict resolution and queue management
‚Ä¢ Real-time calculations with BillboardClass integration

## Entity Flow

The core business logic follows this relationship chain:

**Student** ‚Üí **Booking** ‚Üí **Lesson** ‚Üí **Event**

‚Ä¢ Students purchase packages creating bookings
‚Ä¢ Bookings generate lessons (assigned to teachers)
‚Ä¢ Lessons create events (actual scheduled activities)  
‚Ä¢ Events use kites (equipment) and track completion

### Admin Dashboard System (`/app/(tables)/`)

A comprehensive entity management system providing CRUD operations for all database entities:

**Core Dashboard Component** (`components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`):
‚Ä¢ Reusable table interface with sorting, filtering, and search functionality
‚Ä¢ Dynamic stats calculation and month-based filtering
‚Ä¢ Configurable column headers and export capabilities
‚Ä¢ Entity-specific action buttons and dropdown forms

**Entity Configuration** (`components/dashboard/DashboardGetEntitiesUtils.ts`):
‚Ä¢ Centralized entity configuration with icons, colors, and routing
‚Ä¢ Custom filter logic for each entity type (active/inactive, status-based)
‚Ä¢ Dynamic action button generation with entity-specific workflows
‚Ä¢ Multi-format export function mapping (CSV, Excel, etc.)

**Database Entities Managed**:
‚Ä¢ **Students** - Profile management with booking history and package selection
‚Ä¢ **Teachers** - Instructor profiles with kite assignments and commission tracking
‚Ä¢ **Bookings** - Package purchases with student assignments and status tracking
‚Ä¢ **Lessons** - Individual lesson records with teacher and booking relationships
‚Ä¢ **Events** - Scheduled activities with location, duration, and kite assignments
‚Ä¢ **Packages** - Lesson packages with pricing and capacity configurations
‚Ä¢ **Kites** - Equipment management with teacher assignments and usage tracking
‚Ä¢ **Payments** - Financial records for teacher commissions and payouts

**Features**:
‚Ä¢ Server-side data fetching with client-side filtering and sorting
‚Ä¢ Entity-specific `/form` routes for creation and editing
‚Ä¢ Bulk operations and selection capabilities (students ‚Üí package assignment)
‚Ä¢ Real-time stats with dynamic updates based on filtered data
‚Ä¢ Month-based filtering with localStorage persistence

### UserWallet Authentication System

A Web3-inspired authentication architecture that bridges Supabase Auth with internal role management:

**UserWalletProvider** (`provider/UserWalletProvider.tsx`):
‚Ä¢ React Context provider managing authentication state
‚Ä¢ Session caching with user data transformation
‚Ä¢ Links Supabase users to internal UserWallet records

**UserWallet Table Structure**:
‚Ä¢ `sk` (Secret Key) - Links to Supabase auth user ID
‚Ä¢ `pk` (Public Key) - Optional link to Teacher.id for instructor accounts
‚Ä¢ `role` - System roles: admin, teacher, teacherAdmin, locked, reference
‚Ä¢ `note` - Additional user information and context

**UserWallet Form** (`components/forms/UserWalletForm.tsx`):
‚Ä¢ Admin interface for managing user roles and relationships
‚Ä¢ Dynamic PK assignment for linking teachers to auth accounts
‚Ä¢ Role-based field visibility and validation

**Role-Based Access**:
‚Ä¢ **Admin** - Full system access, entity management
‚Ä¢ **Teacher/TeacherAdmin** - Portal access with PK link to teacher profiles
‚Ä¢ **Reference** - Limited access for booking reference purposes
‚Ä¢ **Locked** - Restricted access status

## Tech Stack

‚Ä¢ **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
‚Ä¢ **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Drizzle ORM and Relations (`drizzle/migrations/relations.ts`)
‚Ä¢ **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with UserWallet system (`provider/UserWalletProvider.tsx`)
‚Ä¢ **Role Management**: Web3-inspired wallet system with `sk` (auth user id) and `pk` (teacher link) keys
‚Ä¢ **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix primitives
‚Ä¢ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
‚Ä¢ **State Management**: Server components with React Context
‚Ä¢ **Time Management**: Custom UTC-based timezone utilities
‚Ä¢ **Queue System**: Linked-list data structures for teacher scheduling
‚Ä¢ **Export System**: Multi-format exports via Billboard actions and Dashboard utilities

## Wind-Responsive Design Philosophy

Kiteboarding is entirely wind-dependent. This application is built around the reality that:
‚Ä¢ Schedules change constantly based on weather conditions
‚Ä¢ Teachers need quick mobile access for on-the-go updates
‚Ä¢ Admin staff need powerful drag-and-drop tools for complex rescheduling
‚Ä¢ All changes must sync immediately across export formats
‚Ä¢ Equipment and teacher availability must be tracked in real-time

*Built for the dynamic world of kiteboarding instruction where adaptability is everything.*
